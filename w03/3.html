          JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a
          programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
          Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use
          JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often
          incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
          dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing,
          prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
          multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
          structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
